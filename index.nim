Programming paradigm by Donald Knuth (1984)

<small>
a computer program is given as an explanation of how it works
in a natural language, such as English,
interspersed (embedded) with snippets of macros
and traditional source code,
from which compilable source code can be generated.
</small>

Inspired:
- Jupyter NoteBook
- Quarto (RMarkdown)
- Nbdev
- ...
- [Nimib]()
"""

- quote is from wikipedia. TODO: check original source

1. Weaving: Generating a comprehensive document about the program and its maintenance.
2. Tangling: Generating machine executable code

- Jupyter is more Interactive Computing
- N and B in Nimib come from NoteBook
- Nbdev closest to original literate programming
- Observable most important and not quoted

Essay by Bret Victor (2011)

<small>
"Explorable Explanations is my umbrella project for ideas
that enable and encourage truly active reading.
The goal is to change people's relationship with text.
People currently think of text as information to be consumed.
I want text to be used as an environment to think in."

**Goal**: make in [NimibLand]() better tools for explorable explanations.
